  <b>IW5 SURVIVAL REIMAGINED</b><br>
  <a>This project aims to replicate to some extent the spec ops survival mode for plutonium dedicated servers.</a> 
  <br><br>
</p>

-The code is planned to be released when a more stable version is available since it is pre-release and still has significant bugs.

# How To Use
- Unzip the rar file at "%localappdata%/plutonium/storage/iw5/"
- To avoid errors remember to load the dsr called survival, it is in the rar
- In the console type "fs_game mods/lb_server" to load the mod

# Warning
- Using the predator can crash the game... why?, I don't know xD
- It will only be possible to play in Dome, and only until round 20
- If you play it alone and wonder why so many bots appear, remember that this mode is designed for a minimum of 4 players
- This version does not have bug fixes if you host it on a server, it may work but it may also have a variety of errors that will be printed on console :D
